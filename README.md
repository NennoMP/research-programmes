# Summer Research Programmes
This is a non-exhaustive list of **(paid)** research programmes for undergraduate students, recent graduates and PhDs. The majority of programmes takes place during the summer.

___
Programmes are categorized by hosting country and include *eligibility* criteria relative to your academic status. Specifically:
- _Undergraduate:_ open to current bachelor's and master's students;
- _Graduate:_ open to recent master graduates (typically within 1 year of graduation);
- *PhD:* open to current PhD students (it may vary depending on the specific research group).

Additionally, relevant research areas offered by the programme are listed in *research areas*. However, I strongly encourage you to check the programme website for more details, and to apply even if your degree is not an exact match.
